I am a passionate Software Developer with expertise in the AI and Fintech space. I have a deep interest in Web3 development, and I've built some amazing tools that have garnered attention.

🌐 **Web3 Content Creator**: In addition to my development work, I'm also a web3 content creator and the author of a newsletter called ["Web3 Bits n Bytes"](https://web3bitsnbytes.substack.com/).  
I enjoy sharing my knowledge and insights with others in the community. As an educator and seasoned engineer, I believe in the power of continuous learning and strive to contribute to the growth of the Web3 ecosystem.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on building an automated test case generation tool for Solidity-based smart contracts.
